Ditched for now interface, I got bored of it. Took care of enemies and killing them and respawning.

What is done?

	- spawn enemies and make them targetable

	- enemies can be killed and respawned after xx turns

	- under enemy corpse texture isn't breaking (took me a while to figure it out, since I was rewriting actual map template to simplify things) - this sounds ridiculous, but after killing peon there would remain black hole of missing tile.

Little work on Inventory Window and small update on armour types.

[-----]
2015-07-18

Didn't do much, too tired and too busy to do it. 

What is done?

	- 10-30% of inventory screen and status screen, needs more work and "prettyfying"

	- moving around on inventory screen (specifically on backpack part)

	- some work on armour

Fooling around with Visual Studio resources and learning how to load them to SFML 2.0

What is done?

	- little bit of basic game interface.

[-----]
2015-07-07

What is done?

	- completed weapon loader.

	- completed armour loader, but not tested thoroughly.

	- figured way to draw user interface.

TODO?

	- test armour loader.

	- complete consumable loader and move with next work, maybe inventory?

Hardware is still faulty, it needs repairs, so thats why I have so long breaks.

What is done?
	
	- had some fun with weapons class. Should be working for now.

TODO?

	- Do same things for armors and consumables. Thats a lot of work...

2015-06-26

What is done?

	- nothing much. Tried to work on items.

Weapon loading is partialy done. Weapon stats doesn't need to be in particular order, tags are all that matters. Now time to work on weapon corrector.

What is done?

	- loading multiple weapons.

	- correcting one property.

	- WeaponHolder to hold all that loaded and corrected data.

TODO?

	- integrate everything into Game module.

After a long, long break, time to get back to work. Also, new goals.

What is done?

	- partial weapon loader. ATM able to load successfully one weapon.

	- a lot of extra enums and structs to make my life easier.


TODO?
	
	- items loader. Big thing.

	- enemies loader. Another big thing.

	- serialization. Need to break down on paper first, but I have general idea how-to this one.

	- items correction when non-crucial data is incomplete

	- items deletion when crucial data is incomplete

2015-05-30

What is done?

	
	- map traversion is complete. Now game won't connect maps when one of them doesn't have any free exit points.

	- also. Code got a little tidier.


[-----]

2015-05-29

What is done?

	
	- map optimalization: from 430MBs of memory @ 500 maps down to 32MBs. Freaking RenderTextures, man.

	- not much besides it. Some minor changes and tidying up code.


TODO?

	- same goals as before.

[-----]

2015-05-28

What is done?


	- as usual, changes to map.

	- map traversing completed! Yay! Hail for infinite map and twisted dungeon!


TODO?

	- optimalize map stuff to reserve less memory.

[-----]

2015-05-27

What is done?


	- map traversing, but I feel it's not really complete

	- some minor changes within maps parsing


TODO?

	- more work on map traversing. I want to tidy this up (especially spawn player at specific entrance spot).

[-----]

2015-05-26

What is done?


	- changing some pointers to smart pointers, specifically map ones

	- preparation to traversing from one map to another and backwards (if they exist and are linked together)

	
TODO?

	- make map traversing

	- think of some map memory optimalization: maybe relaying more on processing than memory would be cool

[-----]

2015-05-25

What is done?


	- not much again. Progressing to next map is done, need optimalization. 

	- Maps can have irregular shapes. Kinda cool it was done previously, just didn't noticed it.

	- one cool map design.

	- run some tests for map size. It appears it can be build to max size of 512x512 tiles, each 32x32px. And I can go for more, but is it nessessary?

TODO?

	- map optimalization. 

	- fast reload of resources

[-----]

2015-05-24


What is done? 


	- again, some movement stuff. Now correctly stops at Exit tiles and doesn't wander off the map. Unless NoClip is enabled.

	- Maps now can come in irregular shape of right and bottom wall.

	- shuffled around code to tidy things up.

TODO?

	- going to next map maybe...?

	- also new enemies would be fine

	- again, some collision would be cool. But not much yet to collide with...

	- and again, some nice textures, for Christ's sake. Not everything, but something like wall and floor texture would be REALLY nice, you lazy f*ck.


[-----]

2015-05-23


What is done?


	- some player stuff, mainly walking around.

	- View is now glued to player, unless moved with Numpad.

	- checking if there is wall, need to be improved.

TODO?


	- some collision would be cool.

	- some nice textures! yah, that would be nice to eyes.


[-----]

2015-05-22


What is done?


	- working view and resize.

	- modified map parser, still incomplete

	- started working on Player class

TODO?


	- move around as player

	- maybe some collision stuff? why not.

	- stick View to player and implement way to move around camera.


[-----]

2015-04-27

What is done?


	- nothing in particular, some changes in MapBuilder.

	- completed map loading of different sizes.


[-----]
2015-04-26/27

What is done?


	- completed MapsHolder, which holds many map schemes

	- completed map loading from file (MapLoader) and started working on map parser

	- started working on main loop

	- started working on map building, basic building is completed


TODO?


	- complete MapBuilder

	- make View window, to move around camera (should be easy)

	- modify MapBuilder to support undefined map size.
