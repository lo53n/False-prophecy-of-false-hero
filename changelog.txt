What is done?


	- not much again. Progressing to next map is done, need optimalization. 

	- Maps can have irregular shapes. Kinda cool it was done previously, just didn't noticed it.

	- one cool map design.

	- run some tests for map size. It appears it can be build to max size of 512x512 tiles, each 32x32px. And I can go for more, but is it nessessary?

TODO?

	- map optimalization. 

	- fast reload of resources

What is done? 


	- again, some movement stuff. Now correctly stops at Exit tiles and doesn't wander off the map. Unless NoClip is enabled.

	- Maps now can come in irregular shape of right and bottom wall.

	- shuffled around code to tidy things up.

TODO?

	- going to next map maybe...?

	- also new enemies would be fine

	- again, some collision would be cool. But not much yet to collide with...

	- and again, some nice textures, for Christ's sake. Not everything, but something like wall and floor texture would be REALLY nice, you lazy f*ck.
